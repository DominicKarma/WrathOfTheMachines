Bestiary: {
	Draedon: A disposable recon body for the esteemed scientist, Draedon. His unyielding dedication to the pursuit of knowledge is as extraordinary as his marked amorality.
	Hades: One of Draedon's finest creations. This automaton expels built up heat and pressure through its vents, concentrating the resulting energy into potent wide-range attacks.
	Ares: One of Draedon's finest creations. This automaton is capable of dynamically detaching its mounted weapons as necessary, and boasts an astonishing affinity for melee combat.
	Artemis: One of Draedon's finest creations. This automaton channels thermal energy through its orange crystalline lattices. It operates in unfaltering unison with Apollo when engaged in combat.
	Apollo: One of Draedon's finest creations. This automaton excels at high-velocity aerial attacks involving its plasma reserves. It is seemingly programmed to be protective of Artemis.
